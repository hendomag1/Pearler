This is a simple calculator designed to help people save for a specific goal: going on holiday
With international borders opening slowly this is a timely script which gives users a straight up answer to how much they would need to save monthly in order to afford
their goal.

There are two modes: simple and advanced
In simple mode, users input their destination and the ticket price, and are given 4 options for saving up for the holiday, based on urgency. Based on the ticket price
(and assuming the money is held in a savings account at 1.5% pa), the program returns how much they would need to save per month in order to leave for the holiday in
a) 3 months, b) 6 months, c) 12 months, or d) 24 months. This can give the user an idea of when they could potentially go on holiday based on how much they save

In advanced mode, there are no assumed factors as there are in simple mode (interest rate, time until holiday). This can allow the user to customsie their savings goal
if they are for example, investing that money in crypto, stocks, etc, and earning more than 1.5% pa, or simply their savings bank account offers more/less than that. 
This can be useful for someone who knows how much their holiday will cost, and when it will be, so they can put the money required for the tickets to the side, and 
save/invest/spend the remainder.
